# Alarmo MQTT Dashboard

This is a simple dashboard for Home Assistant's Alarmo addon. This is a react app mean to be served from a home server and accessed via web browser/fully-kiosk browser. Please view the [example.env](https://github.com/AJax2012/alarmo-mqtt-dashboard/blob/main/example.env) file to update the settings.

## Future plans

I don't have plans to update this much in the future. If this project gets some attention (stars, follows, issues, etc.), I might add some features for ease of use in the future. If you find this project useful, please let me know!
